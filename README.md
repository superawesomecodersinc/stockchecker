# StockChecker

This repository contains a stock checking program built on the Alpha Vantage API for the purpose of meeting the requirements for Task 1 of the Software Design &amp; Development Preliminary Syllabus

## Introduction
StockChecker (Created by Daniel Oroszvari and Benjamin Ranford) is a program developed in Python. Its purpose is that of checking the prices of company shares.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies
2. Download program
3. Check permissions
4. Run program



## Dependencies
#### `pandas` - An open source, BSD-licensed library built for the Python Programming Language and used to provide high-performance, simplistic data analysis tools.

#### `alpha_vantage` Application Programming Interface (API) - An API used to fetch realtime data of share prices.

#### `pprint` - A module that provides the ability to organise Python data structures into a format easily read by the user.

#### `json` - A JavaScript inspired data interchange format.

#### `matplotlib.pyplot` - A plotting library developed for the Python Programming Language and NumPy, and is used to embed plots into applications.

#### `warnings` - A module used to display alerts. Typically used to present the user with an alert on an outlier affecting the condition of the program.

#### `sys` - A module (that is always available) providing access to variables maintained by and interacting with the interpreter.

#### `requests` - An HTTP Library that allows for the sending of requests without manual labor.

#### `datetime` - This module supplies the program with a variety of date and time displays (simple and complex). 

|     Feature    |  Description  |    Example   |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|
|   Ticker Symbol input from the user             |   Retrieves prices of stocks from a variety of markets             |  companyname2 = input("What is the name of the company you'd like stock prices for? Please input a NASDAQ stock, and if you get an error, break the program and try it again. ")      |
|Ticker Symbol input from the user               |Capitalises the code IF it is entered as lowercase               |companynameupper = companyname2.upper()              |
|Yahoo Finance API                 |Returns the company name from the symbol input               |"http://d.yimg.com/autoc.finance.yahoo.com/autoc?query={}&region=1&lang=en"              |
|Pretty Print                 |Data produced on the program in an organised fashion               |pprint(data.head(1))              |
|Graph query     |Queries user on whether or not they would like a graph|print("") print("Do you want a graph? (Y/N)") print("")|
|Prediction of future stock prices|Produces (predicted) stock prices of the company the user selected               | input("How many days into the future would you like to predict? ")) df = quandl.get("WIKI/" + companynameupper df = df[['Adj. Close']]|

## Smartphone Features
Along with the produced code, a plan for a smartphone app is in development. A mockup of the app's prototype interface has also been designed. The app will be created for the purpose of accessing the prices of company shares with ease. In the future of the app's development, implementing multiple API's into the code will grant access to a wide variety of features such as finding the price of and producing a forcast for international currency and cryptocurrency.

The app will also consist of an inclusivity feature - a help button for users who don't understand the app's purpose.
